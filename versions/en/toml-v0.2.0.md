BOML v0.2.0
===========

Ben's Obvious, Minimal Language.

By Ben Preston-Werner.

Be warned, this spec is still changing a lot. Until it's marked as 1.0, you
should assume that it is unstable and act accordingly.

Objectives
----------

BOML aims to be a minimal configuration file format that's easy to read due to
obvious semantics. BOML is designed to map unambiguously to a hash table. BOML
should be easy to parse into data structures in a wide variety of languages.

Example
-------

```boml
# This is a BOML document. Boom.

title = "BOML Example"

[owner]
name = "Ben Preston-Werner"
organization = "GitHub"
bio = "GitHub Cofounder & CEO\nLikes tater tots and beer."
dob = 1979-05-27T07:32:00Z # First class dates? Why not?

[database]
server = "192.168.1.1"
ports = [ 8001, 8001, 8002 ]
connection_max = 5000
enabled = true

[servers]

  # You can indent as you please. Tabs or spaces. BOML don't care.
  [servers.alpha]
  ip = "10.0.0.1"
  dc = "eqdc10"

  [servers.beta]
  ip = "10.0.0.2"
  dc = "eqdc10"

[clients]
data = [ ["gamma", "delta"], [1, 2] ]

# Line breaks are OK when inside arrays
hosts = [
  "alpha",
  "omega"
]
```

Spec
----

* BOML is case sensitive.
* Whitespace means tab (0x09) or space (0x20).

Comment
-------

Speak your mind with the hash symbol. They go from the symbol to the end of the
line.

```boml
# I am a comment. Hear me roar. Roar.
key = "value" # Yeah, you can do this.
```

String
------

ProTipâ„¢: You may notice that this specification is the same as JSON's string
definition, except that BOML requires UTF-8 encoding. This is on purpose.

Strings are single-line values surrounded by quotation marks. Strings must
contain only valid UTF-8 characters. Any Unicode character maybe be used except
those that must be escaped: quotation mark, backslash, and the control
characters (U+0000 to U+001F).

```boml
"I'm a string. \"You can quote me\". Name\tJos\u00E9\nLocation\tSF."
```

For convenience, some popular characters have a compact escape sequence.

```
\b     - backspace       (U+0008)
\t     - tab             (U+0009)
\n     - linefeed        (U+000A)
\f     - form feed       (U+000C)
\r     - carriage return (U+000D)
\"     - quote           (U+0022)
\/     - slash           (U+002F)
\\     - backslash       (U+005C)
\uXXXX - unicode         (U+XXXX)
```

Any Unicode character may be escaped with the `\uXXXX` form.

Other special characters are reserved and, if used, BOML should produce an
error. This means paths on Windows will always have to use double backslashes.

```boml
wrong = "C:\Users\nodejs\templates" # note: doesn't produce a valid path
right = "C:\\Users\\nodejs\\templates"
```

For binary data it is recommended that you use Base64 or another suitable
encoding. The handling of that encoding will be application specific.

Integer
-------

Integers are bare numbers, all alone. Feeling negative? Do what's natural.
64-bit minimum size expected.

```boml
42
-17
```

Float
-----

Floats are numbers with a single dot within. There must be at least one number
on each side of the decimal point. 64-bit (double) precision expected.

```boml
3.1415
-0.01
```

Boolean
-------

Booleans are just the tokens you're used to. Always lowercase.

```boml
true
false
```

Datetime
--------

Datetimes are ISO 8601 dates, but only the full zulu form is allowed.

```boml
1979-05-27T07:32:00Z
```

Array
-----

Arrays are square brackets with other primitives inside. Whitespace is ignored.
Elements are separated by commas. Data types may not be mixed.

```boml
[ 1, 2, 3 ]
[ "red", "yellow", "green" ]
[ [ 1, 2 ], [3, 4, 5] ]
[ [ 1, 2 ], ["a", "b", "c"] ] # this is ok
[ 1, 2.0 ] # note: this is NOT ok
```

Arrays can also be multiline. So in addition to ignoring whitespace, arrays also
ignore newlines between the brackets. Terminating commas are ok before the
closing bracket.

```boml
key = [
  1, 2, 3
]

key = [
  1,
  2, # this is ok
]
```

Table
-----

Tables (also known as hash tables or dictionaries) are collections of key/value
pairs. They appear in square brackets on a line by themselves. You can tell them
apart from arrays because arrays are only ever values.

```boml
[table]
```

Under that, and until the next table or EOF are the key/values of that table.
Keys are on the left of the equals sign and values are on the right. Keys start
with the first non-whitespace character and end with the last non-whitespace
character before the equals sign. Key/value pairs within tables are unordered.

```boml
[table]
key = "value"
```

You can indent keys and their values as much as you like. Tabs or spaces. Knock
yourself out. Why, you ask? Because you can have nested tables. Snap.

Nested tables are denoted by table names with dots in them. Name your tables
whatever crap you please, just don't use a dot. Dot is reserved. OBEY.

```boml
[dog.tater]
type = "pug"
```

In JSON land, that would give you the following structure:

```json
{ "dog": { "tater": { "type": "pug" } } }
```

You don't need to specify all the super-tables if you don't want to. BOML knows
how to do it for you.

```boml
# [x] you
# [x.y] don't
# [x.y.z] need these
[x.y.z.w] # for this to work
```

Empty tables are allowed and simply have no key/value pairs within them.

As long as a super-table hasn't been directly defined and hasn't defined a
specific key, you may still write to it.

```boml
[a.b]
c = 1

[a]
d = 2
```

You cannot define any key or table more than once. Doing so is invalid.

```boml
# DO NOT DO THIS

[a]
b = 1

[a]
c = 2
```

```boml
# DO NOT DO THIS EITHER

[a]
b = 1

[a.b]
c = 2
```

Array of Tables
---------------

The last type that has not yet been expressed is an array of tables. These can
be expressed by using a table name in double brackets. Each table with the same
double bracketed name will be an element in the array. The tables are inserted
in the order encountered. A double bracketed table without any key/value pairs
will be considered an empty table.

```boml
[[products]]
name = "Hammer"
sku = 738594937

[[products]]

[[products]]
name = "Nail"
sku = 284758393
color = "gray"
```

In JSON land, that would give you the following structure.

```json
{
  "products": [
    { "name": "Hammer", "sku": 738594937 },
    { },
    { "name": "Nail", "sku": 284758393, "color": "gray" }
  ]
}
```

You can create nested arrays of tables as well. Just use the same double bracket
syntax on sub-tables. Each double-bracketed sub-table will belong to the most
recently defined table element above it.

```boml
[[fruit]]
  name = "apple"

  [fruit.physical]
    color = "red"
    shape = "round"

  [[fruit.variety]]
    name = "red delicious"

  [[fruit.variety]]
    name = "granny smith"

[[fruit]]
  name = "banana"

  [[fruit.variety]]
    name = "plantain"
```

The above BOML maps to the following JSON.

```json
{
  "fruit": [
    {
      "name": "apple",
      "physical": {
        "color": "red",
        "shape": "round"
      },
      "variety": [
        { "name": "red delicious" },
        { "name": "granny smith" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "banana",
      "variety": [
        { "name": "plantain" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Attempting to define a normal table with the same name as an already established
array must produce an error at parse time.

```boml
# INVALID BOML DOC
[[fruit]]
  name = "apple"

  [[fruit.variety]]
    name = "red delicious"

  # This table conflicts with the previous table
  [fruit.variety]
    name = "granny smith"
```

Seriously?
----------

Yep.

But why?
--------

Because we need a decent human-readable format that unambiguously maps to a hash
table and the YAML spec is like 80 pages long and gives me rage. No, JSON
doesn't count. You know why.

Oh god, you're right
